---+++ Overview

Conduit Visualization project helps in visualizing data that has been delivered by conduit within a given time period. The dashboard allows one to select the time range, cluster and stream for which they wish to see the graph.

The dashboard will query the database populated by the feeder service to get relevant information. Data flows covers all tiers
---+++ Setup
---++++ Installation

Install the deb package databus-visualization.

On installing the package, conf files are copied to /usr/local/conduit-visualization/conf, the war is copied directly to /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps and the environment file setenv.sh is copied to /var/lib/tomcat7/bin
---++++ Configuration

The conf files are audit-feeder.properties(same as that used for feeder service) and visualization.properties

Sample Configuration: [[%PUBURL%/TechPlatform/AuditFeature/audit-feeder.properties_copy.txt][audit-feeder.properties]] [[%ATTACHURL%/visualization.properties][visualization.properties]]

All fields prperties in visualization.properties should be set. Mandatory fields in audit-feeder.properties are jdbc.driver.class.name, db.url, db.username, db.password, audit.table.master and rollup.tilldays

Hadoop home path should be set in /var/lib/tomcat7/bin/setenv.sh file which is copied on installing the deb, before restarting tomcat
---+++++ Config Fields in visualization.properties

If latency &lt;=3 and latency &gt; 3-(loss.warn.threshold.diff.in.mins) then it is in *warn* state, and healthy if *latency* &lt;= 3-(loss.warn.threshold.diff.in.mins)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> *Note*: tomcat should be restarted for dashboard to reflect changes made to config files
---++++ Logs

The logs for the dashboard can be checked at /var/log/visualization and tomcat logs can be checked at either /var/log/tomcat7 or $CATALINA_HOME/logs
