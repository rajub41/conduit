GOAL's for Phase1


 

 [[1]] Make data available reliabily on HDFS within Data Center

 [[1]] Static mapping of scribe collectors, configurable without bringing down the scribe daemon

 [[1]] no VIP/bucket store based load balancing.

 [[1]] Stores supported \- Network & Buffer Store with buffer store supporting FILE Store.

What stores can be used as secondary stores|stores which implement the readOldest() method and currently only file and null stores||
{{{}}}<p>Based on our understanding of running/debugging this system for a while there are primary two reasons</p> <p>1. hadoop filesystem object is cached as is singleton per JVM and since scribe is highly multi-threaded it would benefit from it.</p> <p></p>{{{}}}*----+--+--+
Why does scribe create a new ./FileSystem.htmlFileSystem for each file.|2. DFSClient have a list of blacklisted nodes which AFAIK once formed are kinda static..so to avoid a complete outage that all datanodes are blacklisted and if a datanode was errenous on one connection a seperate thread connecting to the same datanode might be able to move forward.|http://hadoopblog.blogspot.in/2009/06/hdfs-scribe-integration.htmlhttp://hadoopblog.blogspot.in/2009/06/hdfs-scribe-integration.html|

*UseCases

**Buffer Store \- Primary as FileStore(Local FS) & Secondary also FileStore(Local FS)
*----+--+--+--+--+
|UseCase||Behaviour/Observations||Monitoring to catch||Opens||How to try|
<ol> <li>primary is at /data/scribetestdata/ and secondary is at /tmp/scribetestdata and category name is "<strong>test</strong>"</li> <li>primary store is not reachable( permission issue/disk is full) and client is sending new messages.</li> <li>scribe server tries writing to primary fails and retries.</li> <li>scribe server won't buffer to secondary till it reaches max_write_interval/max_write_size and keeps the message in memory and retries based on retry_interval/retry_range </li> <li>In this example we fixed the permission issue in between the retry interval and scribe server wrote the message to /data/scribetestdata/test/test_00000</li></ol><p> Exception < boost::filesystem::create_directory: <br /> Permission denied: "/tmp/scribetest/test" > in <br /> StdFile::createDirectory for path /tmp/scribetest/test <br /> " [Wed Nov 23 11:14:16 2011] "[test] Failed to create <br /></p><ol> <li> scribe server log monitoring for exception's.</li></ol><ol> <li> When does write to secondary store start. What config controls it?</li></ol><a href="../scribe-example.conf"></a>*----+--+--+--+--+
1. Buffer Store - Primary Store being File Store and secondary also being File Store|  directory for file </tmp/scribetest/test/test_00000 | | | example-conf |\<ol\> \<li\>Each category has it's own queue. Messages from multiple producers will get delivered in the order they went in the queue. No support for prioritization. \</li\>\</ol\>
*----+--+--+--+--+
2. Send large number of messages to multiple categories| ||||
\<ol\> \<li\>whichever config among the two reaches first. Tested and it works. \</li\>\</ol\>
*----+--+--+--+--+
3. When are messages processed from queue - target_write_size or target_write_interval| ||||\<ol\> \<li\> Change max_write_size to a smaller value and send large number of messages.\</li\> \<li\>File's get rotated based on max_write_size in both primary and secondary stores.\</li\> \<li\>Tested and works\</li\>\</ol\>
*----+--+--+--+--+
4. File rotation based on max size in primary and secondary stores| ||||
<ol> <li>Revoke permission's of primary store.</li> <li>After target_write_size/target_write_interval whichever is reached, messages move to secondary store.</li> <li>rotation in secondary store happens based on max_size configured/rotation_period which ever takes effect earlier.</li> <li>scribe server keeps retrying based on retry_interval/retry_interval_range </li> <li>fix the permission's of primary store</li> <li>scribe server starts sending messages from secondary to primary and flushes the secondary. Parallelism of data transfer from primary to secondary is controlled via buffer_send_rate </li> <li>Tested above and it works</li></ol>
*----+--+--+--+--+
5. Primary to secondary failover| ||||
\<p\>\</p\>
*----+--+--+--+--+
6. Generate Minute files|file rotation within a category is controlled through max_size/rotate_period which ever happens first if both are set. rotate_period=1m will generate minute files ( No data in 1 min generates 0 bytes files)||||
<ol> <li>based on whichever reaches first scribe sever sends TRY_LATER to producer</li> <li>Tested and works</li> <li>This configuration cannot be reloaded dynamically as it's a scribe server config.</li></ol>*----+--+--+--+--+
7. Throttling through max_msg_sec/max_queue_size| ||||
\<ol\> \<li\>Scribe server gives stats and FILE Store also has stats\</li\>\</ol\>\<\p\> Example Scribe Server stats \> inderbir@gs1102: $ sudo ./scribe_ctrl counters 7463 <br /> test:retries: 83 <br /> test:received good: 135632 <br /> test1:received good: 104002 <br /> scribe_overall:retries: 83 <br /> scribe_overall:received good: 239634 <br /> Example for file store stats File named scribe_stats generated inside the category directory <br />  eg: /tmp/scribe_tesdata/test/scribe_stats with contents <br /> 2011-11-24-12:46 wrote <11183> bytes in <0> events to file </tmp/scribetest/test/test_02223></p>

 [[1]] Building scribe can be tough since code at github(https://github.com/facebook/scribe) hasn't gone a change from June 2011 and it's dependencies versions have done new releases eg: thrift, libboost.

 [[1]] from the repository install scribe\-server\-hdfs & service\-scribe\-server which will get you all the required dependent packages.

 [[1]] <<scribe_cat>><strong> scribe_ctrl </strong>are available inside the source code.

 [[1]] <em><strong>cannot import scribe</strong></em>". Either follow the steps at {{{https://github.com/facebook/scribe}https://github.com/facebook/scribe}} to set PYTHONPATH or you can do \[2\]

 [[1]] Checkout fb303, thrift, scribe PYTHON modules from {{{http://svn.mkhoj.com/svn/dw/flash/flashmon/trunk/scribe_collect_mon/}http://svn.mkhoj.com/svn/dw/flash/flashmon/trunk/scribe_collect_mon/}} and add the following code to scribe_cat

 []




+------+

 sys.path.append('/usr/lib/python2.6/site\-packages/')
 sys.path.append('path to thrift') # path where thrift python packages are
 sys.path.append('path to fb303') # path where fb303 python packages are
